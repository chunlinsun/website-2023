## Course description and prerequisites

Applications, theories, and algorithms for finite-dimensional linear and nonlinear optimization problems with continuous and discrete variables. 
Elements of convex analysis, first- and second-order optimality conditions, sensitivity and duality. 
Algorithms for unconstrained optimization, and linearly and nonlinearly constrained problems. 
Modern applications in data analysis, machine learning, engineering system design, communications, game theory, auctions, and economics.

Prerequisites:
- Math 113 (linear algebra) and 115 (calculus), or equivalent

## Computing environment

We will be using the Julia programming language via Pluto notebooks for in-class demos.
Most optimization solvers are easy to access and swap out from within the Julia ecosystem,
and Julia code is both simple to write and fast to run.
Pluto notebooks allow for better interactivity and reactivity
and are easy to install and use.
[Learn how to install and use Pluto notebooks.](https://plutojl.org/)

Students may use any language they wish (and that the course staff can read) to complete homework assignments and projects.

## Access and accommodations

Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. 

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services, please visit [oae.stanford.edu](https://oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience of this course.

## Diversity statement

It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. We aim to present materials and conduct activities in ways that are respectful of this diversity. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know if you have ideas to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
