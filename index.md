## Course description

An increasing amount of data is now generated in a variety of disciplines, 
ranging from finance and economics, to the natural and social sciences.
Making use of this information requires both statistical tools and an
understanding of how the substantive scientific questions should drive
the analysis. In this hands-on course, we learn to explore and analyze
real-world datasets. We cover techniques for summarizing and describing data,
methods for statistical inference, and principles for effectively communicating 
results.

Office hours are a great opportunity to discuss not only topics directly related to the course, 
but also anything else that's on your mind beyond the class, including, for example, 
questions about career trajectories, and [research opportunities](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research) in MS&E and beyond.
